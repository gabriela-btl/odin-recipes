    <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓) is a traditional Japanese 
        dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), 
        usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a 
        variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood, 
        often raw, and vegetables. </p>
    <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish. </p>
