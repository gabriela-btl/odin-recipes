    <h1>Ramen recipe</h1>
    <img src="ramen-gif.gif" alt="ramen picture">
    <p>Ramen <em>(/ˈrɑːmən/) (拉麺, ラーメン, rāmen)</em> is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork <em>(叉焼, chāshū)</em>, nori (dried seaweed), menma, and scallions.  </p>
    <p> <strong>Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen</strong>, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu, and the miso ramen of Hokkaido. Mazemen is a ramen dish that is not served in a soup, but rather with a sauce (such as tare).

        <li>1 tbsp of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp of sesame or vegetal oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp of fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of fresh garlic</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of soy-sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of mirin</li>
        <li>1 oz of dried shitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of scallions</li>
        <li>ramen noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <em>this recipe is for chicken ramen but you can adapt it to your needs.</em>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Cook the chicken</strong>: Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
        <li> <strong>Make the ramen broth</strong>: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the stock, cover, and bring to boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.</li>
        <li> <strong>Make the soft-boiled eggs</strong>: Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yoke) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yoke).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.</li>
        <li> <strong>Assemble the ramen bowls</strong>: Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. <strong>It's ready !</strong></li>
    </ol>
