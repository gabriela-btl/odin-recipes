    <h1>Onigiri recipe</h1>
    <img src="onigiri.gif" alt="onigiri picture">
    <p>Onigiri <em>(お握り or 御握り)</em>, also known as omusubi <em>(お結び)</em>, nigirimeshi <em>(握り飯)</em>, or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori.[a] Traditionally, an onigiri is filled with pickled ume (umeboshi), salted salmon, katsuobushi, kombu, tarako, mentaiko, takanazuke (pickled takana) or any other salty or sour ingredient as a natural preservative. Most Japanese convenience stores stock their onigiri with various fillings and flavors. There are even specialized shops which only sell onigiri to take out. Due to the popularity of this trend in Japan, onigiri has become a popular staple in Japanese restaurants worldwide. </p>
    <p>Despite common misconceptions, <strong>onigiri is not a form of sushi</strong> and should not be confused with the type of sushi called nigirizushi or simply nigiri. Onigiri is made with plain rice (sometimes lightly salted), while sushi is made of rice with vinegar, sugar and salt.[1] Onigiri makes rice portable and easy to eat as well as preserving it, while sushi originated as a way of preserving fish. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice (koshihikari rice recommanded)</li>
        <li>Furikake</li>
        <li>Nori</li>
        <li>Some fillings of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
        <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands. </li>
        <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
    </ol>
